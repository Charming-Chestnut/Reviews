getting reviews of a product
/get/reviews/:product_id
need to join products with reviews with photos.
return all information from reviews table & photos table where product id matches query.

Attempt 1:
select reviews.review_id, reviews.rating, reviews.summary, reviews.recommend, reviews.response, reviews.body, reviews.date, reviews.reviewer, reviews.helpfulness, review_photos.id, review_photos.url FROM products JOIN reviews on products.product_id = reviews.product_id JOIN review_photos on reviews.review_id = review_photos.review_id where product.product_id = 1000011;

Attempt 2:
It seems like I need to separate the fetching of reviews from the fetching of review photos--if I join all tables and try to get a review with no photos, I'm unable to. The two queries below seem to work.

select reviews.review_id, reviews.rating, reviews.summary, reviews.recommend, reviews.response, reviews.body, reviews.date, reviews.reviewer, reviews.helpfulness FROM products JOIN reviews on products.product_id = reviews.product_id where products.product_id = 1000011;

select review_photos.review_id, review_photos.id, review_photos.url FROM products JOIN reviews on products.product_id = reviews.product_id JOIN review_photos on reviews.review_id = review_photos.review_id where products.product_id = 1000011;

Attempt 3:
select review_id, rating, summary, recommend, response, body, date, reviewer, helpfulness FROM reviews where product_id = 1000011;

select review_photos.review_id, review_photos.id, review_photos.url FROM reviews JOIN review_photos using (review_id) where reviews.product_id = 1000011;

Attempt 4:
I figured out how to fetch everything I needed! I ended up using a left join with review_photos so I could include records where photos were missing. This query took 5.3ms to operate.

select reviews.review_id, reviews.rating, reviews.summary, reviews.recommend, reviews.response, reviews.body, reviews.date, reviews.reviewer, reviews.helpfulness, review_photos.id, review_photos.url FROM products JOIN reviews using (product_id) LEFT JOIN review_photos using (review_id) where reviews.product_id = 1000011;
